AppDelegate.cpp 函数中applicationDidFinishLaunching()
中的这段代码是什么意思；   
   // Set the design resolution
#if (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_WINRT) || (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_WP8)

#else
    pEGLView->setDesignResolutionSize(designResolutionSize.width, designResolutionSize.height, kResolutionNoBorder);
#endif

    // this can make sure that the resource's height could fit for the height of design resolution.
